## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rj-invest-insights.git
cd rj-invest-insights

- **International Focus**: Moderate risk (6/10), moderate diversification (65%), currency risk concerns

## Configuration

### Database Configuration
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following default settings:
- Database: `invest_insights`
- Username: `iiAdmin`
- Password: `RayJay1!`
- Port: `5432`

### API Configuration
- **OpenAI**: Required for AI insights generation
- **Finnhub**: Required for market news and company data

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables for API keys. Create a `.env` file in the `ai_microservice/` directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
```

**Security Note**: The `.env` file is automatically ignored by Git to prevent accidental exposure of API keys. Each user must create their own `.env` file with their actual API keys.

## Testing the System

1. **Login as ii-Admin**
2. **Select different clients** to see various portfolio scenarios
3. **Generate AI Insights** for each portfolio to see different analysis types
4. **Compare portfolios** to understand risk and diversification differences
